# Gateway Discord Bot

Source code for the bot on my Discord server hosted on Autocode. It features general-purpose functions such as styled panels (rules, games, etc), roles and notifications panels that utilize Discord's drop down select menus, and bot status displaying member count.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project was originally made on a bot hosting website called Autocode which has shut down since April 26th, 2024.
